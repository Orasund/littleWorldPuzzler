# Devlog 7 - Cards!

It is time to display some cards. Im using [Orasund/elm-card-games](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Orasund/elm-card-game/latest/) for rendering cards. I won't go into to much detail how this package works.

# Backpack

The Backpack is a space next to the selected card where the player can store cards for later.
This was a long needed mechanics, that also existed in the original game.
Up until this point, the player was at the mercy of the deck.
Starting off with a water card meant you needed to reset right away.
But now, you can just store that card in the backpack and use it later.
