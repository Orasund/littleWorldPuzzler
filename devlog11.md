# Devlog 11

Hello again :)

This time around, i focused on visuals.

I believe the game play is more or less done, so i expect the next couple of devlogs to be about polishing the game.

This time around i implemented a proper "Round Won" and "Round Lost" screen. And then I also improved the card backs.
